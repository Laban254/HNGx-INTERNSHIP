Throughout my HNGx virtual internship experience, I had the privilege of working on a variety of projects, each showcasing different aspects of my skills and expertise. 
- [STAGE-1](./STAGE-1)
	- This is an ExpressJS endpoint
      â™‹ [  API Live  Link](https://hngx-internship-meo4.onrender.com/api?slack_name=laban254&track=backend)

   This API, built using Express.js, provides information based on query parameters. It returns the current day, UTC time, and other data for a github username and the track done during the internship when queried at the /api endpoint.

- [STAGE-2](./STAGE-2)

 	This project focuses on creating a user-friendly REST API capable of performing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on "person" resources. Powered by MongoDB, it seamlessly manages data persistence. The API dynamically adapts to parameters, allowing actions based on a person's name.
