Throughout my HNGx virtual internship experience, I had the privilege of working on a variety of projects, each showcasing different aspects of my skills and expertise. 
- [STAGE-1]()
	- This is an ExpressJS endpoint
      â™‹ [  API Live  Link](https://hngx-internship-meo4.onrender.com/api?slack_name=laban254&track=backend)

   This API, built using Express.js, provides information based on query parameters. It returns the current day, UTC time, and other data for a github username and the track done during the internship when queried at the /api endpoint.

- [STAGE-2]()

 	This project aims to develop a simple REST API capable of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a "person" resource, 		interfacing with a chosen database system. The API also dynamically handles parameters, enabling actions based on a person's name.
